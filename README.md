# Reflex - Next-Generation E-Commerce Machine Customer Platform

## Overview

Reflex is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the e-commerce experience by leveraging the concept of **Machine Customers**. These are autonomous AI agents capable of shopping on behalf of users, making data-driven purchasing decisions, and optimizing the entire shopping process. Reflex integrates advanced technologies, including Generative AI, IoT, and machine learning, to create a seamless, personalized, and efficient shopping experience.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Shopping**: AI agents evaluate products, compare deals, and make purchasing decisions based on user-defined preferences.
- **User and Device Onboarding**: Easy setup for new and existing users, including IoT device integration.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Configure automatic replenishment thresholds (e.g., order more coffee pods when supply drops below 10).
- **Market Research**: AI agents conduct market research to recommend the best products and deals.
- **Compliance and Vendor Integration**: Ensures compliance with user preferences and integrates with multiple vendors for seamless transactions.
- **Order Management**: Tracks orders, manages deliveries, and handles returns or exchanges.
- **Demand Prediction**: Utilizes data analysis and correlation modules to predict product demand accurately.
- **IoT Integration**: Leverages IoT devices to monitor usage and trigger automatic replenishment.

## How It Works

1. **User Onboarding**: Users set up their preferences and configure thresholds for automatic replenishment.
2. **Device Integration**: IoT devices are onboarded to monitor usage and send data to the platform.
3. **Market Research**: AI agents conduct market research to find the best products and deals.
4. **Product Comparison**: Agents compare products based on user-defined criteria.
5. **Automatic Ordering**: When thresholds are met, agents automatically place orders.
